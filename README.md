## Undetected C / C++ Reverse Shell
As we **never** got the chance (meaning a proper Pentesting or Redteaming job) to use it, we'd be happy if it remained **undetected**. 

You can achieve that by modifying the code before compiling. 

At the day of publishing it's been running as Scheduled Task for almost 2 years, every 30 min, on a Windows 10 Pro and was never detected. Although not encrypting data stream, not even our PFSense blocked the connection - and it is usually pretty snappy, not really sure, why. 

## We mean it
Please. Make Bypass001.cpp our legacy. We'll leave this world with nothing but suffering and absurdity. Make this code live forever. Make it our mutual act of rebellion. 

*"The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free, that your very existence is an act of rebellion." - Albert Camus
